      <p class="paragraph">
        “We best serve others by reminding them of their song. Judgment,
        punishment, and power plays don’t correct; they only drive human beings
        further from their joy and aggravate pain and self-defeating behavior.
        When someone is in distress or conflict, we help them remember who they
        really are, and they’ll have no need to hurt others.”
